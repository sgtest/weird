# A weird repo

The intent of this repo is to provide a collection of edge cases for exploratory testing.

This repo is organized by type of edge case:

- [`blame`](./blame) contains files with weird git blames
- [`commits`](./commits) contains weird commits (or at least docs for tags containing weird commits)
- [`content`](./content) contains files with unusual contents
- [`dirs`](./deep) contains weird directories
- [`filenames`](./filenames) contains files with unusual names
- [`language`](./language) contains files that might mess with language detection
- [`links`](./links) contains weird file links

## TODO

- Hard links
- Git submodules
- Poorly-formed commits
- "a symbolic link whose value is a zip file (not a path)" (courtesy of Keegan)
- Files with expensive syntax highlighting
