# A weird repo

The intent of this repo is to provide a collection of edge cases for exploratory testing.

This repo is organized by type of edge case:

- [`commits`](./commits) contains weird commits (or at least docs for tags containing weird commits)
- [`content`](./content) contains files with unusual contents
- [`deep`](./deep) is a 50-level nested directory tree
- [`filenames`](./filenames) contains files with unusual names
- [`language`](./language) contains files that might mess with language detection
- [`size`](./size) contains files with random contents of various size up to 10MB
