# Weird commits

This directory contains scripts which produce weird commits. The commits live on refs outside the main branch
so they don't interfere with the commit history of this repository.

Available tags:

- `deep-commits-1k`, `deep-commits-10k`, `deep-commits-100k`, and `deep-commits-1m` are various points along a 1-million commit linear history as produced by `./deep-commits.sh`
- `old-commits-yearly`, `old-commits-monthly`, and `old-commits-daily` contain commits from 1980 to 2023 on a yearly, monthly, or daily interval.
